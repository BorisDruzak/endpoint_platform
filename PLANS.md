# Endpoint Platform Plan

## Goal

Deliver Wave 1 Device Context, then expose normalized projections in web_ovpn without coupling that panel to raw agent results.

## Current State

6A enrollment and update control-plane work are merged locally. Device Context
foundation has passed independent review and local acceptance: strict profiles,
bounded ALT collectors, fixed Gateway capabilities, additive lifecycle/snapshot
storage, safe service routes, scheduler and retention. The typed safe SDK plus
the feature-gated `web_ovpn` adapter API and Russian-first endpoint pages have
also passed local review in clean worktrees. Explicit netctl correlation has
also passed review without IP-only matching. ALT packaging/provisioning and the
isolated test-agent acceptance harness are complete. A valid wildcard
`*.sosnadmin.local` certificate is in active use on the TLS source host; its
private key has not been copied into the workspace.

## Constraints

- web_ovpn and network_configuration remain read-only until a clean dedicated worktree exists.
- ALT Linux is first; no real device collection, deployment, or canary belongs to the foundation.
- Collectors are bounded/read-only; safe APIs never expose raw result payloads or credentials.
- The periodic allowlist is baseline (24h), health (5m) and network (15m).
  Diagnostic is manual-only. Scheduler and retention are local server work;
  their migration must not be run remotely in this foundation task.
- DNS for `endpoint.sosnadmin.local` is configured and the internal CA is
  available as deployment input outside Git. TLS verification remains mandatory.
- Disk resize is cancelled. Deployment uses the existing disk only after a
  capacity check confirms it is sufficient; no resize is a prerequisite.

## Next Steps

1. Complete and independently review the ASGI, systemd, Nginx, and controlled
   production-runbook assets on branch `codex/endpoint-production-deployment`.
2. Run the local release gate, then execute the controlled production gate:
   re-check capacity, install PostgreSQL and Nginx, deploy the verified
   release, transfer TLS material without workspace persistence, and run the
   forward migration only after settings validation.
3. Run the agent pilot only after production API and strict TLS smoke checks
   pass.

## Verification

Foundation completion needs strict contracts, collector privacy/capability,
PostgreSQL lifecycle/idempotency, semantic hash/diff, scheduler/retention,
safe projection and generated-schema tests. Scheduler keeps one active request
per device/profile and expires bounded offline work; retention preserves the
current snapshot, its prior snapshot and explicit pins.

## Handoff

No remote migration, web_ovpn deployment or network change is authorized
before the production deployment gate passes. The `web_ovpn` service
token/client, netctl correlation and real pilot are distinct later
deliverables.
